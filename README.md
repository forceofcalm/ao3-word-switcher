# AO3 Skin: Word Switcher
Hello!

This web application is an assistive tool for creating AO3 skins that can be turned on or off so that readers can read with character names or terms they may prefer.

The generated skin is completely unintrusive to all readers' experiences. If the skin is on, readers will see the switched word. When the skin is off, users will see the original word. Screen readers will appropriately read which ever word is the visible one. Users who have work skins turned off will see the original word.

## Example
There is a character that may have gone unnamed in canon for long enough that fans devised a common name for them in their works. Then, suddenly, the canon shifts and this character receives an official name.

Some fans prefer the name that the fandom created, while others might prefer the the new canon name.

Anyone involved in fanworks knows that some fans are very particular about these sorts of things, sometimes avoiding works with their unpreferred name altogether.

With the generated work skin, a creator can offer that accessibility to their readers. Similarly, the generated skin can easily be included alongside the code in existing work skins without affecting anything visually that may be styled.

The words are intelligently parsed, so different words that may have the chosen word within them will be unaffected. If you want to switch out the name "Ren" for "Akira", your "appa**ren**tly"s and "a**ren**'t"s will remain safely unaffected, while every instance of "Ren", "Ren's", "Ren'd", and so forth will be switched.

## Using the web application
Enter the word you want to switch that *currently exists in your text* as the "original word" and add the alternate word as the "switched word".

**Tip:** It may be best to have *your* perfered version as the switched word, as it will be the one most users see by default. This would also require you to alter your work with the less-preferred word. The choice is up to you.

You can click the button to add more switched words, if you choose to do so.

When you're ready, paste your work text into the leftmost text box. *It may be better if you allow AO3 to parse your text first, automatically adding any `<p>` and `</p>` tags before you do this, but it is not necessary, as this will add them for you if you do not have them.* The previews, formatted text, and work skin code will be updated automatically.

The formatted text is what you will copy into as your work text. The work skin code should be pasted into [your new work skin](https://archiveofourown.org/skins/new?skin_type=WorkSkin). You can copy this text by clicking the button, and paste them by clicking the text box you want to paste into and holding `CTRL` (Windows) or `CMD` (MacOS) and hitting `V`.

Copy the formatted text into the body of your work, and apply the work skin you just made onto your work. Viol√†! There are now two versions of your work within one work for users to view, and they can toggle between the two by turning the work skin on or off.
